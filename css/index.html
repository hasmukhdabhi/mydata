        <p><a href="http://w3https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>The 2006 Securitas depot robbery in
            Tonbridge, Kent, was the largest ever cash heist in the
            UK. Seven criminals stole almost £53 million in used and unused Bank of England sterling banknotes. After
            months of preparation, the gang abducted the manager and his family, then tricked their way inside the
            building
            (pictured) and tied up fourteen workers at gunpoint. Kent Police recovered over £19 million; by 2007, 36
            people had been arrested in relation to the crime. At trial in London, five people were convicted and
            received long
            sentences, including the inside man, Emir Hysenaj. Lee Murray, the alleged mastermind of the heist, had fled
            to Morocco with his friend and accomplice Paul Allen. Murray successfully fought extradition to the UK and
            was
            eventually imprisoned for the robbery there instead. Allen was extradited and after a second trial in 2008
            was jailed. A decade later, £32 million had not been recovered, and several suspects were still on the run.

    <div class="contener">CSS Another Example</div>

    <h2>Position: Static</h2>
    <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the
        normal flow of the page:</p>
    <div class="static">This div element has position: static</div>

    <h2>Position: Relative</h2>
    <P>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</P>
    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative</div>

    <h2>Position: Fixed</h2>
    <P>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
        place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the
        element.
    </P>
    <div class="fixed">This div element has position: fixed</div>
    <h2>Position: Absolute</h2>
    <P>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</P>
    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute

        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Position: Sticky</h2>
    <P>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</P>
    <p>A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative
        until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>

    <div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
    <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position.
    </p>
    <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>

    <h2>Positioning Text In an Image</h2>
    <h3>Image Text</h3>
    <P>Add some text to an image in the top left corner:</P>
    <div class="container"><img src="img/bg2.jpg" alt="bg2" width="500" height="300">
        <div class="topleft">Top Left</div>
    </div>

    <h2>CSS Flexbox Layout Module</h2>
    <p>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Block, for sections in a webpage</li>
        <li>Inline, for text</li>
        <li>Table, for two-dimensional table data</li>
        <li>Positioned, for explicit position of an element</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Flexbox Elements</h2>
    <p>A Flexible Layout must have a parent element with the <em>display</em> property set to <em>flex</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>Text1</div>
        <div>Text2</div>
        <div>Text3</div>
    </div>

    <h2>The flex-direction Property</h2>
    <p>The "flex-direction: column;" stacks the flex items vertically (from top to bottom):</p>
    <div class="flex-container1">
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
    </div>
    <h2>The flex-flow Property</h2>

    <p>The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for the flex-direction and the flex-wrap properties.</p>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
        <div>4</div>
        <div>5</div>
        <div>6</div>
        <div>7</div>
        <div>8</div>
        <div>9</div>
        <div>10</div>
        <div>11</div>
        <div>12</div>
    </div>

    <h2>The flex-wrap Property</h2>

    <p>The "flex-wrap: nowrap;" specifies that the flex items will not wrap (this is default):</p>

    <div class="flex-container-3">
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
        <div>4</div>
        <div>5</div>
        <div>6</div>
        <div>7</div>
        <div>8</div>
        <div>9</div>
        <div>10</div>
        <div>11</div>
        <div>12</div>
    </div>

    <p>Try resizing the browser window.</p>

    <h2>The justify-content Property</h2>

    <p>The "justify-content: center;" aligns the flex items at the center of the container:</p>

    <div class="flex-container-4">
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
    </div>


    <h2>CSS Flex Responsive</h2>
    <!-- <h3>Responsive Flexbox</h3> -->
    <ul>
        <li>Laptop and Desktops:</li>
        <li>Mobile phones and Tablets:</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Responsive Flexbox</h2>

    <p>In this example, we change the percentage of flex to create different layouts for different screen sizes.</p>
    <p><b>Resize the browser window to see that the direction changes when the
            screen size is 800px wide or smaller.</b></p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item-left">1</div>
        <div class="flex-item-right">2</div>
    </div>
